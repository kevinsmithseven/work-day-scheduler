# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is a calendar application that will allow the user to enter and save tasks to complete by hour during the course of a normal workday. The app time blocks dynamically changes colors throughout the day based on the time. Time blocks in the past are yellow, the current hour is in green and the future hours are in light blue. The user can enter a task into a specific time block and hit the save icon on the right of that block, and the information will be saved for them. It will also be available after a page reload.
